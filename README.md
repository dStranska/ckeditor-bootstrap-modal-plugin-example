ckeditor-bootstrap-modal-plugin-example
=======================================

requirements
------------
- twitter bootstrap's modal lib
- mustache
- jquery
- ckeditor

notes
-----

Think of this as a reference implementation; the config file shows how to
inform CKEDITOR of your plugin's existence, and the plugin file shows how to
get ahold of the CKEDITOR hooks. This plugin can be modified to not use
Mustache, not use jQuery, not use Twitter Bootstrap w/not much effort.
